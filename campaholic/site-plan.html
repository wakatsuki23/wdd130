        [CAMPAHOLIC
        This page was created with the love of all things nature in mind. My family and I enjoy the outdoors so much that any given chance we have, we take advantage and go camping. Camping has brought us closer together as we unplug our selves from daily grind. 
         you can always find us either at a campsite or gathering things for our next camp sesh- att a lover of the outdoors.

      <h1>Types of camping</h1>
      <p>
        Locations
        Dispersed camping 
        -state and federal land 
        If you want to get away from the crowds and camp for free, 
         Most state parks and national parks have open areas where you are free to set up and camp anytime because it is public land. There may be restrictions based on your area. To make sure you are not breaking any laws, you can contact the local rangers for information. They are very friendly and will let you know about fire restrictions, best places to camp, closed roads (depending on the season), and they’ll also be able to warn you of any wild life to watch out for. 
        </p>
        <h2>Campgrounds</h2> 
          <p>If you are scared to winging it, and are fairly new to dispersed camping or camping at all, there is well established campgrounds that can be easily found by doing a quick google search, or visiting the recreation.gov for easy reservations. The campgrounds sometimes have first come first serve, reserved spots for both RV and tent camping. To make sure you have you have a spot plan and reserve your spot in advance.
          Most campgrounds will have firepits, a designated pads for your tent, vaulted restrooms close to your camp, and some may even provide showers. 
          The fees depend on the stay duration, size of your camp, and can vary from state to state.

        [Planning your trip
        Having a go to checklist is a must, have one that you can always go back to. Edit this list before, during, and after your camp trip. The more you camp the more you become an expert at what works and doesn’t work for you / your family. 
        –(I find myself always remembering last minute what I forgot to bring. ) 
        It is best to print directions, or maps before hand because generally camping areas have little to no reception. 
        Do a quick check for weather conditions to make sure you pack the right clothes and or equipment. 
        Planning your meals ahead of time helps to make sure you do not forget key ingredients. 
        Make sure you always tell someone outside of your circle where you will be going, there has been plenty of recorded incidents make sure you do not add to the statistics.
        
        Essentials list 
        •	Sleeping bag- depending on the temperature of the night where you are sleeping, you want to have a sleeping bag that is rated for the weather that you will be facing. For example, if the temperature at night is 40 degrees, your sleeping bag needs to be rated for at least 20 degrees. 
        
        •	Sleeping pad- the ground is not your friend, imagine sleeping on a wood plank, a sleeping pad makes sure you have extra cushion comfort. it does not have to be expensive; this will just separate you from the cold hard ground. You can also take a air mattress but it takes up more space. 
        
        
        •	Tent – There is many different tents out there. Make sure that the tent you choose will fit you, your family and any extra items you want to keep safe and dry.  For example, if it is a family of four, it is best to spend the extra money to get a six-person tent, it gives you extra clearance, that can help the space feel less crowded. 
        
        •	Flashlight, lamp & headlamp- Because you are away from the city it gets really dark at night. Depending on the moon phase you can find yourself in a pitch-black environment when camping. It is extremely important to not rely on your cellphone light only. A flashlight with at least one set of extra batteries will come in handy. 
        
        
        •	Knife- good utility tool 
        •	Camping chair- no one likes to sit on the dirt, a chair will be more comfortable place to sit by the fire and watch the shooting stars. 
        •	Food & water- basic human necessities 
        •	Firewood – can keep you warm / cooking and roasting marshmallows -it’s a must!  
        
        ** This list is based off a tent camping, not for backpacking or RVs

        Common curtesy
        
        Always stomp out your fire never leave embers; these are easy to re-spark and start fires.
        If you are in a shared camping ground, it is common courtesy to have Lights out at 10:00 p.m., this includes excessive noise.
        always leave your campsite better than how you found it. 
        Dispose of your trash in the proper receptacles.
