                If you want to get away from the crowds and camp for free,Most state parks and national parks have open areas where you are free to set up and camp anytime because it is public land. There may be restrictions based on your area. To make sure you are not breaking any laws, you can contact the local rangers for information. They are very friendly and will let you know about fire restrictions, best places to camp, closed roads (depending on the season), and they’ll also be able to warn you of any wild life to watch out for.
