  <h2> Leslie Wakatsuki </h2>  
  <p>Hello new friends,I am a stay at home mom, I have been happily married for 8 years with two children. 
    5 Year old Samantha and a 1 Year old Luca. A little bit after my son was born, 
    I decided it was time to go back and finish proper school.
    So here I am on my third attempt at finishing college. 
  </p> 
  <p>I chose to pursue Web development because it intrigues me 
    and once finished it seems to be a way to work from home and enjoy my children a bit more. </p>
  <p>As for my hobbies at the moment I am devoted to practicing my shooting capabilities at the range, 
    love fishing but not touching or eating the fish, or anything sea food in general.
  </p>
